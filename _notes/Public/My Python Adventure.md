<font size="+3">This is the page that I will share my adventure along the way of learning python.

The definition of a computer is "an electronic device that **manipulates information, or data** in a dictionary" basically it is a machine that processes data just like all the other machines. Based on this mindset we can relate computers working principle with the functions in mathematics. ***f(x)= 2x+5*** meaning in order to find ***f(x)*** the variable ***x*** should be multiplied by ***2*** and aded ***5*** to that multiplication. Essentially functions are there to "**manipulate information, or data**" for you in a program with a lot of them bonded together. 
<br>
```c
print("Hello World")
```
Is the simplest form of function in **Python** it is used for writing the string (a sequence of characters) to the launcher window.
<br>
<br>
In addition to functions there are some other term as well: **Variables** 
We use variables to temporarily store data in computerâ€™s memory.

```python
price = 31

rating = 6.9

blog_name = â€˜Python Adventureâ€™

is_published = True
```
**In the above example,**

â€¢ ``price`` is an integer (a whole number without a decimal point)

â€¢ ``rating`` is a float (a number with a decimal point)

â€¢ ``blog_name`` is a string (a sequence of characters)

â€¢ ``is_published`` is a boolean. Boolean values can be True or False.

Simple Weight Converter (kg to lbs):
```python
weight_lbs = int(input('What is your weight in terms of kg: '))  
weight_kg: float = weight_lbs * 2.2  
print('Weight in lb: ')  
print(weight_kg)
```


**Indexes:**
In python indexes start from 0.
this value can be (-) this means index starts from the end of the string
``print(variable[:])`` 


There are two ways to add variables in a string:
**Ane of them is using + command.**
*As shown in* ***message*** *variable*:
**Another one is f string method**
In this method instead of opening and closing the string and adding them one by one, we just open some *holes* in the string with {} 
*As shown in* ***msg*** *variable*:

```python
first_name = 'Yigit'  
last_name = 'Olcar'  
message = first_name + ' [' + last_name + '] is a coder'
msg = f'{first_name} [{last_name}] is a coder'  
print(msg)  
print(message)
```

In this case when print command occurred both msg and message variables will have the same string values. 

******

Examples for **methods** in python: 

```python
course = 'python for beginners is here heheheh lol'
print(len(course))  
print(course.upper())  
print(course.lower())  
print(course)  
print(course.find('b'))  
print(course.replace('beginners','ABSOLUTE vodka'))
print('python' in course)
```

**If, Elif, Else**
A simple program for identification for:
If an applicant has good or bad credit to calculate the down payment value and the final discounted price.

```python
price: int = 1000000  
buyer_credit = input('is your credit good')
if buyer_credit.lower() == 'yes':  
    print('20% decreased is')  
    down_payment = 0.2 * price  
elif buyer_credit.lower() == 'no':  
    print('10% decreased is')  
    down_payment = 0.1 * price  
print(f"price of the house is {price} $")
print(f"Payment: ${price - down_payment}")
```
1st Run:
```
is your credit good yes
20% decreased is
price of the house is 1000000 $
Payment: $800000.0
```
2nd Run:
```
is your credit good no
10% decreased is
price of the house is 1000000 $
Payment: $900000.0
```

*********

Logical Contitions:

- Or/ at least one true

```python
has_high_income = False  
has_good_credit = True 

if has_good_credit or has_high_income:
    print("Eligible for loan")
```
Run:
```
Eligible for loan
```

- And/ both are true

```
has_high_income = True  
has_good_credit = True

if has_good_credit and has_high_income:  
    print("Eligible for loan")
```
Run:
```
Eligible for loan
```

- Not/ inverses boolean values

```python
has_criminal_record = True  
has_good_credit = False  
  
if has_good_credit and not has_criminal_record:
    print("Eligible for loan")
```

```
Eligible for loan
```

*********

Comparison Conditions:
Used for making a boolean value at the end

```python
<   --->  smaller than
<=  --->  smaller than or equal to
>   --->  greter than
>=  --->  greater than or equal to
```

Note len() gives the number of characters in a strings

```python
name = input("Write a name: ")
if len(name) <= 3:  
    print('name must be at lest 3 characters long')
elif len(name) >= 50:  
    print("name can be a maximum of 50 characters")
else:  
    print("âœ“")
```
1st Run:
```
Write a name: yigit
âœ“
```
2nd Run:
```
Write a name: ttt
name must be at lest 3 characters long
```
3rd Run:
```
Write a name: ttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
name can be a maximum of 50 characters
```

*********


**While loops**
While loops are used for looping the code until a condition is reached:
As shown below variable `i` is equal to 1 at  first and a while loop is introduced which increases `i` one at a time until it reaches the final value of 5 and prints done at the end to show "loop is finished and is terminated" to the user.
```python
i = 1  
while i <= 5:  
    print(i)  
    i = i+1  
print('done')
```
Run:
```
1
2
3
4
5
done
```
Same thing can be made with replacing the integer with a string then string will be multiplied unit reaches the limit '5'
<br>
Then the terminal after the Run will look like:
```
*
**
***
****
*****
done
```

**********

For Loops
```python
for i in 'Pyhton':  
    print(i)
```


In for loop two variables are needed ``for `i` in `numbers`:`` i variable is used only in the loop for iterating the list given in the second variable, `numbers`.

For loops = execute a block of code a fixed number of times .
You can iterate over a range, string, sequence, list etc.

Shopping List Summation:
```python
prices = [10, 20, 30]  
total = 0  
for price in prices:  
    total = total + price  
print(f"Total:{total}")
```
Run
```
Total:60
```

*********

```python
sayilar = [20, 30, 60]  
sum = 0  
for sayi in sayilar:  
  sum = sum + sayi  
  print("Sayi:", sayi)  
  print("Sum:", sum)
```


```python
numbers = [1, 4, 9, 5, 8]  
max = numbers[0]  
for number in numbers:  
    if number > max:  
        max = number  
print(max)
```

```python
numbers = [3, 5, 8, 0, 79, 9, 4, 1, 7]  
max = numbers[0]  
for i in numbers:  
    if max < i:  
        max = i  
print(max)
```

*******

**Nested looops**
Loops that are inside one another
```python
for x in range(4):  
    for y in range(3):  
        print(f"({x}, {y})")
```
  
```python
numbers = [2, 2, 2, 2, 5]  
for x_count in numbers:  
    output = ''  
    for count in range(x_count):  
        output = output + 'x'  
    print(output)  

```

********
2D Lists
```python
matrix = [  
    [1, 2, 3],  
    [4, 5, 6],  
    [7, 8, 9]  
]  
for row in matrix:  
    for item in row:  
        print(item)
```

Run:
```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```

****************

```python
numbers.append(6)       # adds 6 to the end

numbers.insert(0, 6)    # adds 6 at index position of 0

numbers.remove(6)       # removes 6

numbers.pop()           # removes the last item

numbers.clear()         # removes all the items

numbers.index(8)        # returns the index of first occurrence of 8

numbers.sort()          # sorts the list

numbers.reverse()       # reverses the list

numbers.copy()          # returns a copy of the list
```

*********

```python
numbers = [1, 4, 9, 5, 8]  
print(50 in numbers)
```
Run
```
False
```

**********


```python
numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7]  
unique = []  
for number in numbers:  
    if number not in unique:  
        unique.append(number)  
print(unique)
```
Or
```python
numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7]  
numbers2 = numbers.copy()  
  
for number in numbers2:  
    if numbers.count(number) > 1:  
        numbers.remove(number)  
  
print(numbers)
```
Or
```python
numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7]  
numbers2 = numbers.copy()  
  
for number in numbers2:  
    if number in numbers:  
        numbers.remove(number)  
  
print(numbers)
```
***********

```c
Tuples

They are like read only lists. We use them to store a list of items. But once we

define a tuple, we cannot add or remove items or change the existing items.

coordinates = (1, 2, 3)

We can unpack a list or a tuple into separate variables:

coordinates = (1, 2, 3)  
x = coordinates[0]  
y = coordinates[2]  
z = coordinates[3]  
  
x, y, z = coordinates

```

Emoji Converter
```python
message = input(">")  
words = message.split(' ')  
emojis = {  
    ":)": "ðŸ˜ƒ",  
    ":(": "ðŸ˜§"  
}  
output = ''  
for word in words:  
    output+= emojis.get(word, word) + " "  
    print(output)
```

**********

Functions
```python
def greet_user(first_name, last_name):  
    print(f'Hi there {first_name} {last_name}!')  
    print('Welcome aboard')  
  
  
print("Start")  
greet_user(last_name="bas", first_name="deniz")  
print("Finish")
```


Emoji Converter with making it a function to make that code reusable
```python
def emoji_converter(message):  
    words = message.split(' ')  
    emojis = {  
        ":)": "ðŸ˜ƒ",  
        ":(": "ðŸ˜§"  
    }  
    output = ''  
    for word in words:  
        output += emojis.get(word, word) + " "  
    return output  
  
  
message = input(">")  
print(emoji_converter(message))
```

*******
Managing errors

We use try and except in order to manage errors.
We don't want our code to crash, so we make some exceptions for it not to crash.
```python
try:  
    age = int(input('Age: '))  
    print(age)  
except ValueError:  
    print('Invalid Value!!!')
```

```python
try:  
    age = int(input('Age: '))  
    income = 20000  
    risk = income / age  
    print(age)  
except ValueError:  
    print('Invalid Value!!!')  
except ZeroDivisionError:  
    print('Age cannot be zero(0)')
```

**********

***Classes***

I talked about different types such as integers or boolean values floats etc. 
Class is how we define different types. For example a point in a two dimensional plane  is neither a boolean nor integer its just a point. Or same thing can be applied to a shopping cart a shopping cart is a shopping cart. 
With using **Classes** we can define what a point is. We use classes to define new types basically.
```python
class Point:  
    def move(self):  
        print('move')  
    def draw(self):  
        print('draw')  
  
point1 = Point()  
point1.x = 10  
point1.y = 20  
print(point1.x)  
  
point2 = Point()  
point2.x = 15  
point2.y = 25  
print(point2.x)  
  
point1.move()  
point1.draw()
```

Run
```
10
15
move
draw
```
