This is the page that I will share my adventure along the way of learning **python**.
<br>

<br>
The definition of a computer is "an electronic device that **manipulates information, or data** in a dictionary" basically it is a machine that processes data just like all the other machines. Based on this mindset we can relate computers working principle with the functions in mathematics. ***f(x)= 2x+5*** meaning in order to find ***f(x)*** the variable ***x*** should be multiplied by ***2*** and aded ***5*** to that multiplication. Essentially functions are there to "**manipulate information, or data**" for you in a program with a lot of them bonded together. 
<br>
```
print("Hello World")
```
Is the simplest form of function in **Python** it is used for writing the string (a sequence of characters) to the launcher window.
<br>
<br>
In addition to functions there are some other term as well: **Variables** 
We use variables to temporarily store data in computer’s memory.

```
price = 31

rating = 6.9

blog_name = ‘Python Adventure’

is_published = True
```
**In the above example,**

• price is an integer (a whole number without a decimal point)

• rating is a float (a number with a decimal point)

• blog_name is a string (a sequence of characters)

• is_published is a boolean. Boolean values can be True or False.
