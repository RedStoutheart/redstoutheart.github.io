<br>
```
weight = float(input('Weight: '))  
conv = input("(L)bs or (K)g: ") 

if conv.upper() == "K":  
    var = weight * 2.20  
    print(f"You are {var} pounds")  
  
elif conv.upper() == "L":  
    var = weight * 0.45  
    print(f"You are {var} kilos")  
  
else:  
    print("write K or L")

```
1st Run
```
Weight: 78
(L)bs or (K)g: l
You are 35.1 kilos
```
2nd Run
```
Weight: 31.1
(L)bs or (K)g: k
You are 68.42 pounds
```
3rd Run
